This is the Client Application for the bw galaxy server application.
I have tried my best in the limited time given and I hope I meet up
to your to expectations

The application sends request to localhost port 8080. which the server application should be running on.

please note that usernames and emails must be unique when registering a new user by admin else the application just throws an error and do nothing.

logging out of the application just discards the Jwt token. please this should be taken into consideration.
